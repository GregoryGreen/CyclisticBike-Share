# CyclisticBike-Share


Scenario
“You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.”
Riders who pay for an annual membership are more profitable than casual riders, according to data research.
The marketing department is considering developing a campaign to entice casual passengers to become members.
The team wants to look at the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to see whether there are any patterns in how casual and member users use bikes.
